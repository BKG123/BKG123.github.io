# Hey, I'm Bejay! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I'm a **Generative AI Software Engineer** with over **2.5 years** of experience, building cool stuff with large language models and generative AI systems.  
I love solving real-world problems through tech — without getting stuck endlessly grinding DSA. (Been there, done that.)
