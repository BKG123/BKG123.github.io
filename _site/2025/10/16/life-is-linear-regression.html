  <figcaption>Life's complexities can be understood through the lens of weighted combinations</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When I started learning ML, I was first introduced to Linear Regression. In short, it describes an algorithm where you can model a function using a linear expression:</p>

<p><strong>y = wx + c</strong></p>

<p>Largely similar to the equation of a straight line. Here, the value of <strong>y</strong> (dependent variable) changes with <strong>x</strong> (independent variable).</p>

<p>Now, if we extrapolate this to multiple independent variables:</p>

<p><strong>y = w‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + w‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ + ‚Ä¶ + w‚Çôx‚Çô + c</strong></p>

<p>In most use cases of linear regression, this is the case. An outcome or output is dependent on multiple factors.</p>

<p>Suppose you‚Äôre modeling the house price of a city using linear regression. You‚Äôll find that historically, the price of a house depends on multiple factors ‚Äî area, number of rooms, sq footage, parking (available or not), and so on. The Linear Regression algorithm tries to find those coefficients ‚Äî w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶ w‚Çô ‚Äî and we get a model (or equation) on which, if we feed in new values of x‚ÇÅ‚Ä¶x‚Çô, we can ‚Äúpredict‚Äù or ‚Äúestimate‚Äù the cost of the house in question.</p>

<p>Now, the idea of this blog is not to deep dive into LR. It‚Äôs because I seem to find a parallel between everything in life and this mathematical concept ‚Äî not the linear part, but the <strong>combination part</strong> where everything is a combination of multiple things with different scaling factors associated with each of them.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="for-example">For example:</h3>

<p>Suppose you missed a train on a certain day. You become extremely angry and start blaming your mom for apparently ‚Äúmaking you late‚Äù by asking you to eat breakfast before leaving. But this is <strong>black-and-white thinking</strong> ‚Äî sure, it might have played a role. But there are other factors here as well to consider. Like the fact that you slept late last night despite knowing you have a train to catch the next day. Also, the traffic at that time was more than usual.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/2025-10-16-life-is-linear-regression/image2.png" alt="Multiple factors contributing to missing a train" />
  <figcaption>Missing the train isn't about one factor ‚Äî it's a weighted combination of breakfast delay, waking up late, traffic, and more</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If I were to put it in the equation:</p>

<p><strong>minutes_late = w‚ÇÅ(breakfast_delay) + w‚ÇÇ(woke_up_late) + w‚ÇÉ(traffic_level) + w‚ÇÑ(distance_to_station) + w‚ÇÖ(train_punctuality) + c</strong></p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>minutes_late</strong> = how many minutes late you arrived at the station (or how close you were to missing the train)</li>
  <li><strong>breakfast_delay</strong> = time spent on breakfast (in minutes)</li>
  <li><strong>woke_up_late</strong> = how late you woke up compared to planned time (in minutes)</li>
  <li><strong>traffic_level</strong> = traffic congestion factor (could be 1-10 scale, or actual delay in minutes)</li>
  <li><strong>distance_to_station</strong> = distance you need to travel (in km)</li>
  <li><strong>train_punctuality</strong> = how early/late the train typically runs (in minutes)</li>
  <li><strong>c</strong> = baseline constant (accounts for other unmeasured factors)</li>
</ul>

<p>The weights (w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, w‚ÇÉ, etc.) represent how much each factor contributes to the outcome. For instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maybe <strong>w‚ÇÇ</strong> is large because waking up late has a huge cascading effect</li>
  <li><strong>w‚ÇÅ</strong> might be small because breakfast only added 5 minutes</li>
  <li><strong>w‚ÇÉ</strong> could be moderate depending on how unpredictable traffic is</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>The more experiences I have in life, the more I resonate with this.</p>

<p>Now, I know real linear regression has assumptions about linearity and independence that life often violates. But as a mental model for thinking about multiple factors contributing to outcomes, it works surprisingly well.</p>

<p>This also helps me approach differences in opinions in a calmer and composed manner. Let‚Äôs say India wins a cricket match ‚Äî some say it was because of Virat‚Äôs ton. Some say it‚Äôs because of Bumrah‚Äôs fifer. Or some say it was because of Rohit‚Äôs quickfire 25 off 10 balls.</p>

<p>I say <strong>it‚Äôs all of that</strong>. Just with different weights.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="another-example">Another example:</h3>

<p>Someone says, ‚ÄúThey broke up because he was toxic.‚Äù</p>

<p>But reality?</p>

<p><strong>relationship_strain = w‚ÇÅ(miscommunication) + w‚ÇÇ(incompatible goals) + w‚ÇÉ(external stress) + w‚ÇÑ(personality issues) + w‚ÇÖ(past baggage) + c</strong></p>

<p>We love single-factor explanations because they‚Äôre simple. But life is <strong>multivariate</strong>, not binary.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ever since I started viewing life through this lens ‚Äî not the <em>linear</em> part of Linear Regression, but the <em>weighted combination</em> part ‚Äî I‚Äôve become less judgmental, more curious, and surprisingly more forgiving.</p>

<p>Because nothing ‚Äújust happens.‚Äù</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/2025-10-16-life-is-linear-regression/image3.png" alt="Life as a sum of weighted factors" />
  <figcaption>Every outcome in life is the sum of multiple factors, each with its own weight ‚Äî plus a bit of randomness</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Outcome = Œ£ (all factors √ó their weights) + some randomness</strong></p>

<p>And most of us are just bad at estimating the weights.</p>
